# Q3WorkV2

Running work database on the phone via avery large JSON file - this version makes it easier for user entry.

There is still a problem where if the user presses the keyboard delete to erase the number, the look up is using .Filter and everytime the user changes. the number the filter re-indexes the complete JSON file stopping the phone from working.
